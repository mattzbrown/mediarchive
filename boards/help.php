<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I sign up for the boards?</b><BR></font>
Simply head to the <a href=\"/boards/\">Message
Board Home Page</a> and click the &quot;Register&quot; link you see towards the top of
the screen.  If you can't find it, it's also available from the &quot;Log In&quot; links
located on every regular board page.  Registration is available to all
users aged 13 and over.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Is it free?</b><BR></font>
".$sitetitle." does not charge any fees of any type for any content or services on 
the site.  The only thing you have to lose is your spare time.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why do I have to be 13 or older to register?</b><BR></font>
Thanks to COPPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we
cannot collect information (such as an e-mail address) from any user under
the age of 13 without a parent's permission.  The amount of paperwork and
tracking required to prove the identity of the parents is substantial
for a site of this size, and could increase costs so much as to cause 
the site to shut down.  You'll find that most sites (even
those with much more financial backing) have the exact same restriction.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I activate my account?</b><BR></font>
When you register, you'll have to enter a valid e-mail address that you can
receive mail from.  An activation key is then mailed to that address, and 
you'll have to either click on the link in the mail or type it in manually.
Registration ensures that each account can be tracked back to the owner of
an e-mail account, and allows you to recover your password should you forget
it.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why didn't I receive my activation key?</b><BR></font>
Whenever you sign up for the ".$sitetitle." message boards, you must use a valid,
working e-mail address that you can receive mail from. If you don't receive 
your activation key after signing up, there are several likely reasons why 
this has happened:
<UL><LI><I>You didn't provide your correct e-mail address.</i> 90% of the 
bounced confirmation notices we receive are due to people providing invalid 
or non-working addresses. Remember, your e-mail will look something like 
&quot;yourname@domain.com&quot;, and your address very probably does not begin with 
&quot;www.&quot;.</li>
<LI><I>You're blocking external mail.</i> If you use AOL or Compuserve 2000, 
you can set up your mail filters to block all external mail, which means that 
your confirmation key will never get to you. Change your settings to accept 
mail from non-AOL sites in order to receive your confirmation e-mail.</li>
<LI><I>Your mailbox is full, or your mail server is having problems.</i> You 
need to make sure you can receive mail before signing up.</li></ul><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How can I get my activation key re-sent?</b><BR></font>
Simply log in to your account, access your User Preferences page (by clicking
on your username in the blue bar at the top of the screen), and click
&quot;Re-Send My Activation Key&quot;.  You'll be able to enter in a new e-mail address
as well if you mis-typed it the first time.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why doesn't my activation key work?</b><BR></font>
You'll receive an error message in one of two circumstances:
<UL><LI><I>You already activated your account.</i> Try logging in to your account 
and check your authorization level (it's listed next to your username in the 
blue status bar). If your authorization level isn't &quot;0&quot;, then your account 
is already active.</li>
<LI><I>You didn't enter the activation URL correctly.</i> Some e-mail programs can 
cut off the last digits of the URL, and that entire URL is required in order 
to activate your account. You may need to type in the URL by hand and make 
sure that you enter the entire string in order to activate your account.</li></ul><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why I can't stay logged in to my account?</b><BR></font>
You must have cookies enabled to use the message boards. The cookie that is 
used to stay logged in is not persistent, and is simply used to track your 
session on the site so you don't have to log on to every page.  Some browser
security settings can stop your browser from using cookies, so you may need
to adjust your system settings.<P>
In Microsoft Internet Explorer, in the Tools menu, select &quot;Internet Options&quot;, 
go to the Security Tab, and on the Custom Settings screen make sure that 
&quot;Allow per-session cookies&quot; is enabled.<P>
In Netscape, in the Edit menu, select &quot;Preferences&quot;, go to the &quot;Advanced&quot; 
menu, and on the cookies screen make sure that you have not disabled cookies 
or that &quot;".$sitetitle.".com&quot; is not in your blocked cookies list.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I post messages or create topics on the boards?</b><BR></font>
Once you've created your account, activated it, and logged in, you should see
a link in the blue menu bar near the top of the screen saying &quot;Create New
Topic&quot; or &quot;Post New Message&quot; wherever you're allowed.  If you don't see either
of those links, then the problem may be that you're not logged in with an 
active account, or the message board you're reading doesn't allow you to 
post or create topics at your level.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why do I have to use a certain e-mail address to register?</b><BR></font>
In order to sign up for ".$sitetitle.", all you need is a working e-mail address.
Unfortunately, since it's possible to get hundreds of different free 
addresses, there have been people who create multiple accounts on the boards 
for the sole intention of causing major problems and offending other users. 
When this happens to an extreme, it becomes necessary to &quot;block&quot; certain ISPs 
from being able to use alternate e-mail addresses to sign up.<P>
For example, if you are connecting from AOL or Compuserve, you must use an 
AOL or Compuserve e-mail address to sign up. Similar restrictions apply to 
several other ISPs around the world, and are always been added and removed as
problems arise and disappear.<P>
If you do not have an e-mail address that ends with one of the required 
extensions for your ISP, then you cannot sign up for the boards normally.
If you have an e-mail address that was properly assigned by your ISP, yet
it's not in the &quot;allowed domains&quot; list when you sign up, you can contact
".$sitetitle." with this information.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>I got a message saying I'm using a &quot;proxy server&quot;.  What does that mean?</b><BR></font>
A proxy server is a server that basically funnels Internet traffic through
a common point.  The main problem is that there are thousands of &quot;open&quot; proxy
servers on the Internet that actually disguise the IP address of the user,
letting them be relatively anonymous when creating accounts.  We've found over
the years that when people are allowed to sign up without any kind of 
accountability for their actions in this manner, they more often than not
wish to abuse the system and not use it for any constructive purpose.<P>
If you are using one of these proxy servers for your own privacy, you will need
to disable it at least for the initial sign-up and log-in process on the
site.  While we do understand your desire for privacy, our need for security
simply outweighs it in this case, and our privacy policy does prevent us from
using any information you give us unless you break the rules.<P>
If you were not aware that you were using a proxy server, you should contact
your ISP's support staff or system administrator and ask them for assistance.<P>
If you are using a closed proxy server (one that does not mask identities and
cannot be used from external sites) and feel that the block is in error,
please contact ".$sitetitle." with the full details of the situation, and the 
matter will be investigated.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What do I do if I forget my password or username?</b><BR></font>
Use the Lost Password form to have your username and password mailed to you.
There's a link from the Log In page to the form if you need it, and it
will send mail based on the &quot;Private E-mail&quot; listed for your account (which
defaults to the account you signed up with).<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>I got an e-mail or IM from someone at ".$sitetitle." asking for my password.  Should I give it to them?</b><BR></font>
Nobody from ".$sitetitle." will ever ask for your password, under any circumstances.
If someone claims to be from ".$sitetitle." in e-mail or IM and is asking for your
account information, it's more than likely that it's someone trying to break
into your account.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What are the rules here?</b><BR></font>
The message board rules are spelled out clearly in the Message Board
<a href=\"/boards/tos.php\">Terms of Service</a>, or 
TOS.  The TOS will be enforced strictly, but the majority of the rules are common
sense, and the large majority of board accounts are never found violating 
them.  It is highly recommended that all new users read the TOS at least
once before posting on the boards.  You should also read the Board Rules and
Regulations help file for some additional tips.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What is Karma and how do I get it?</b><BR></font>
Karma is the numerical representation of your board status.  Accounts earn
Karma at a rate of one per day that the account is logged in, as long
as the account has at least one active post on the message boards.  If the
account is not used to log in within a 24-hour period or has no messages
actively posted on the boards, then no Karma is gained for that day.<P>
Karma is lost when an account is used to post messages that are in violation
of the TOS; 3 Karma for a &quot;Notification&quot;, and 10 Karma for a &quot;Warning&quot;.<P>
As your Karma increases, so does your board level, which grants additional
privileges and features on the boards.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How does the moderation system work?</b><BR></font>
Any user level 15 or higher can mark messages that violate the TOS for 
moderation.  By clicking on the &quot;Message Detail&quot; link right above each message,
you'll be taken to a new screen that allows you to report the violation to
the moderation staff.  The moderators then will review the message, and if they
find that it does indeed violate the TOS, it will be deleted.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How can I change my signature and other settings?</b><BR></font>
You can go to your User Preferences page simply by clicking on your username
in the blue bar at the top of each board, topic, or message listing.  From 
there, you can adjust your settings and make changes to your signature or
quote.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why doesn't my quote show up when I post messages?</b><BR></font>
The <I>quote</i> is shown only on your user information page, and does not appear in
your posts.  Your <I>signature</i> is the text that is appended to any message you
post.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I make my text bold, italic or underline?</b><BR></font>
You can use the standard HTML bold, italic, and underline tags.  &lt;b&gt; marks the 
beginning of <B>bold</B> text, &lt;/b&gt; ends it.  &lt;i&gt; marks the 
beginning of <I>italic</I> text, &lt;/i&gt; ends it.  &lt;u&gt; marks the 
beginning of <u>underline</u> text, &lt;/u&gt; ends it.  Be warned, however, that
posts made in all bold/italic/underline could be considered disruptive, and would
be deleted as TOS violations.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I delete my own message or topic?</b><BR></font>
Once your account is Level 15 or higher, you can click on the &quot;Message Detail&quot;
link for your own message and use the deletion option there.  You cannot 
delete any topic that contains more than your own first post, nor can you
delete the message that was used to create the topic.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How do I close my own topic?</b><BR></font>
If nobody has posted in your topic for 20 miniutes, you can close it.
Simply click on the &quot;Message Detail&quot; link for your first message in the topic 
and use the close option there.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How can I become a moderator?</b><BR></font>
You can't.<P>
Seriously, new moderators are only chosen a few times a year, and the minimum
requirements for applying are very steep.  Even so, hundreds apply, but only
a few are selected.  If you seriously want to be a moderator, you'll need to 
be an active, TOS-following board user for well over four months to even be 
considered.  Pestering the current moderators or administrators to become a 
moderator essentially guarantees that you won't be selected.<P>";

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What are the basic rules here?</b><BR></font>
The message board rules are spelled out clearly in the Message Board
<a href=\"/boards/tos.php\">Terms of Service</a>, or 
TOS.  The TOS is enforced strictly, but the majority of the rules are common
sense, and the large majority of board accounts are never found violating 
them.  It is highly recommened that all new users read the TOS at least
once before posting on the boards.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>I found an offensive message/topic. What do I do?</b><BR></font>
Mark it for moderation. Click on the &quot;Message Detail&quot; link right above the 
message, select a reason, and submit it. This will inform the moderators that 
you believe that the message is violating the TOS, and they will act on it 
if they agree with you.  Your account must be at least level 15 before being 
allowed to mark messages for moderation.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What actions can the moderators take on a marked message?</b><BR></font>
If the moderators find a message to be violating the TOS, there are several
actions they can take.
<UL><LI>Delete Only: The moderators can delete a message or topic from the 
boards with no additional penalty to the poster.  This often happens for very
minor or technical violations, but should not be seen as a warrant to continue
the same behavior.</li>
<LI>Notification: In addition to deleting the message, the moderators can
notify the user of the infraction, reducing their Karma by three at the
same time.  This is done for more severe violations, and the user will receive
a system notification when this happens.  It is hoped that by notifying the
user of their moderation, they will understand what it is they've done wrong
and can correct their behavior.</li>
<LI>Warning: If a TOS violation is repeated, severe, or intentional, the 
moderators can place a warning on the user's account, which leaves them at
Level 5 for two days.  While warned, a user cannot create topics and can post
very few messages per day, and 10 Karma is also deducted from the user.</li>
<LI>Suspension:  If a TOS violation is repeated, severe, or intentional, and
the user has shown a clear disregard for the site rules, they can be suspended,
preventing them from making any more posts.  Suspended users are reviewed
by an administrator, who can permanently ban them from the site or take other
less severe action if they feel that the user deserves a second chance.</li></ul>
Moderators can also close and move topics as necessary.<P>
If a marked message is not a TOS violation or the marking feature was used
abusively, the moderators can also choose to ignore or de-prioritize any 
further marked messages from that user, or even suspend them if the need
arises.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>There's another user on the boards who is harassing/annoying me. Can you stop it?</b><BR></font>
If that user is violating the TOS, you can alert the moderators simply by 
marking that user's messages for moderation. If the user is not violating the 
TOS, they have as much right as you to post messages on the board.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Can banned accounts be restored?</b><BR></font>
No.<P>
Accounts are only banned for intentional or repeated TOS violations. In the 
case of the former, the user intentionally got their account banned, and in 
the case of the latter, they were warned repeatedly about it. There's no 
excuse for either kind of behavior.<P>
The only case in which a banned account will be restored is if the banning
was found to be accidental or as the result of a misunderstanding.  These 
cases are few and far between, and generally only apply to the banning of
users who accidentally report that they are underaged.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What is a usermap and what does it mean?</b><BR></font>
Each account may have a &quot;usermap&quot; associated with it that tracks all accounts
that were used from a shared computer at some point over the past 60 days. If
any one of the accounts on a usermap are banned, the administrator may also
ban any other accounts on that list.  As many people do have multiple accounts,
this adds a layer of accountability to those users.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>My brother/cousin/friend/roommate posted those messages, not me!  Why did you ban me?</b><BR></font>
".$sitetitle." accounts are the sole responsibility of the account holder.  Any
messages posted on an account are assumed to be from the account owner, and
any TOS violations committed will count against that account. Futhermore,
any accounts listed on a usermap are considered to be under the control of
account holder, so if one account is banned for severe TOS violations, they 
all risk the same punishment.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Why did my message get moderated when another message that said the same thing didn't?</b><BR></font>
The ".$sitetitle." message boards are, for the most part, self-moderated by its 
users. Any user with a regular account can mark messages for moderation, and 
then only those messages marked are reviewed by the site's moderators to see 
if they do indeed violate the Terms of Service.<P>
If your message was deleted by a moderator, that's because another board user 
marked your message, and the moderator found it to be in violation of the TOS
and deleted it. Messages are looked at one at a time and not compared to other
messages on that same board. If your post violated the TOS, it will be 
deleted. If you see someone else's post that violates the TOS in the exact 
same way, you have the ability to mark that message for moderation as well.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What can I do if I feel that a moderation was unfair?</b><BR></font>
For up to 14 days after your moderation, you can contest it.  From your user
preferences page, view your moderation history and then select the moderation
you wish to examine.  If you feel your message did not violate the TOS or that
the moderation was too harsh under the circumstances, you can send it to the
moderator who originally deleted it along with an explanation.  If your 
argument is successful, the moderator can overturn their own decision and 
restore some or all of your lost Karma, and even return your post to the boards.
Should you not agree with the moderator's contest decision, you can appeal
the moderation directly to an administrator.  However, if your appeal fails, you
will lose the right to contest any further moderations for up to one month.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>I have a right to free speech! What right do you have to delete my messages?</b><BR></font>
Yes, you may have a right to free speech, but not here. When you signed up for 
the ".$sitetitle." message boards, you <I>voluntarily</i> gave up the right to certain
kinds of speech in return for the ability to use the boards. If you do not 
feel that you can follow the rules here, you have the right to create your 
own message boards and make your own rules there. ".$sitetitle." is a private 
business, and if you'd actually read the Bill of Rights, you'll see that 
&quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; applies to the government, not here.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How long do posts stay on the boards?</b><BR></font>
The daily purge process removes older topics from boards every night at 4AM
".$sitetitle." time.  Depending on how many messages a board has, the following
schedule is followed:
<UL><LI>Under 100 Messages: 30 Days</li>
<LI>100-250 Messages: 20 Days</li>
<LI>250-500 Messages: 15 Days</li>
<LI>500-1000 Messages: 12 Days</li>
<LI>1000-2500 Messages: 10 Days</li>
<LI>2500-5000 Messages: 7 Days</li>
<LI>5000-7500 Messages: 6 Days</li>
<LI>7500-10000 Messages: 5 Days</li>
<LI>10000-12500 Messages: 4 Days</li>
<LI>12500-15000 Messages: 3 Days</li>
<LI>15000-30000 Messages: 2 Days</li>
<LI>30000-50000 Messages: 1 Day</li>
<LI>Over 50000 Messages: 1/2 Day</li></ul>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How long do moderated messages stay on my account?</b><BR></font>
Delete-only moderations stay on your account for 15 days.  Karma-loss 
moderations remain for 30 days.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>How long will my account last if I stop using it?</b><BR></font>
Level 0, 1, 10, and 11 accounts are removed from the system after 30 days without
a login.  Level 15 accounts are removed from the system after 90 days, and
level 20 accounts after 180 days.  Once an account is higher than level 20, it
will not be purged.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>When are account levels updated?</b><BR></font>
Account changes for gaining higher levels or coming off of Warned status take
place every night shortly after midnight ".$sitetitle." time.  Karma for the day is
also awarded at this time.<P>
